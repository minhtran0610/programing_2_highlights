# programming_2_highlights
The highlights of my work during the Programming 2 courses at Tampere University.

This repository includes the most oustanding parts of my work during Programming 2 at Tampere University. The projects are all included in the repository,
as well as the most challenging assignments.

The final GUI project is in the folder 13/pairs_gui. The GUI is implemented using QTCreator.

The content of the course includes C++'s value semantics, STL containers, backtracking, memory management, and graphical user interface.
